**Guardian Angel** is a Google Glass platform designed to detect dangererous environments, and provies a quick way to notify friends, family, and authorities.

Description
------
Guardian Angel detects your danger level using the sensors built into Google Glass, combined with our custom algorithms to prevent unknowingly being in a hostile environment.

Learn about what areas are the most dangerous before you get there. Using live updates from every customer, you can see the safety of areas around the world.

A quick voice command or gesture will alert nearby citizens, police, family, and friends of your immediate danger. Send real time updates of your status to the authorities.
